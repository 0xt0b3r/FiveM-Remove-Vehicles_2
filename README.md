## FiveM Remove Vehicles

This is a script for FiveM to get rid off vehicles that people leave after they disconnect. It will automatically delete not used vehicles. It does not restrict number of vehicles that players are able to spawn, it just removes all of the vehicles spawned by player that disconnects.

### Installation

To download go to [releases tab](https://github.com/Shrimpey/FiveM-Remove-Vehicles_2/releases) and download latest zipped release. Unzip and place *RemoveVehicles_2_0* folder in your resources folder, then start the resource in your *server.cfg*.

### Issues

Feel free to file an issue if something is not working as intended (it is tough for me to test this script in all possible scenarios, because it requires multiple people to test it out) or fork it and modify as you want.
